- shoot and destroy asteroids that get in your way
- be careful not to shoot all the asteroids because you'll need to use them for a boost

### Gameplay Brief

- ship flys to the right as the inversion zone of asteriod slowly grows causing a faster pull backwards when not excellerating and more asteriods to spawn in moving from right to left. Player must endlessly dodge, slingshot off of, and shoot down anything that flys in their way.
